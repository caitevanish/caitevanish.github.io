    <h1>Hi. I'm Caitlin</h1>
    <h3>Front end developer + Designer</h3>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m an Arizona native currently living in the Bay Area. I was raised near
      Phoenix and I am a member of the Navajo Nation. I graduated from the
      University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ with an Art History degree and a 2D
      Studio Art minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      With 5+ years of experience working as a muralist, an assistant and
      collaborator with artists, graphic designers, and freelancers, co-creating
      with other creative entrepreneurs revealed to me that I enjoyed making the
      creative process streamlined and automated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It eventually came to my attention that the ﬁne arts was no longer my long
      term, career direction. It took the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic for me to see
      that my eye for detail and my analytical, problem solving mind could be
      quenched by the challenges of web development and programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2022 I graduated from devCodeCamp (a full stack development coding
      bootcamp) and within a year I saw many of my dream projects become
      full-ﬂedged programs.
