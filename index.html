          <strong
            >I’m an Arizona native currently living in the Bay Area. I was
            raised near Phoenix and I am a member of the Navajo Nation. I
            graduated from the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ with an Art
            History degree and a 2D Studio Art minor.</strong

          <br />
          With 5+ years of experience working as a muralist, an assistant and
          collaborator with artists, graphic designers, and freelancers,
          co-creating with other creative entrepreneurs revealed to me that I
          enjoyed making the creative process streamlined and automated.
          <br />
          It eventually came to my attention that the ﬁne arts was no longer my
          long term career direction. It took the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic for me
          to see that my eye for detail and my analytical, problem solving mind
          could be quenched by the challenges of web development and
          programming.
          <br />
          In 2022 I graduated from devCodeCamp (a full stack development coding
          bootcamp) and within a year I saw many of my dream projects become
          full-ﬂedged programs.
